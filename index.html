                <p> What is traditional medicine?</p>
                <p>Traditional medicine (TM) is defined as “the sum total of knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, improve or treat physical and mental illnesses”.</p>

                    <p>What is the importance of traditional medicine?</p>
                    <p>Contrary to those beliefs, however, traditional medicine has proven to be quite effective in treating both chronic diseases and psychological problems, especially those associated with stress, which frequently stem from social alienation, anxiety or loss of self-esteem. </p>

                <p>What is tribal medicine?</p>
                <p>The tribal medicine is not a codified system. Through experience the disease is diagnosed and treated. Even the primitive surgeries they make are their own and perform in their home setting..</p>
